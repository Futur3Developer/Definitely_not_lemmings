# Definitely_not_lemmings
Project was inspired by the well-known game Lemmings and a need to pass C++ course. Mostly the latter.
For this reason it was more of a C++/Qt learning experience than an attempt at making full-fledged game clone.

## Installing
Download the files contained in the .zip from releases and execute Definitely_not_lemmings.exe - Have fun!

## Features
+ **3 different levels:** You can select one of the levels with such meaningul names as "Level 1", "Level 2" or "Level 3".
+ **Level designer:** You can create a new level on your own - create a map, decide how many lemmings should be spawned, how many need to be saved and which classes will be available to make it happen. You may play it right away and also save it for later!
+ **Adjustable game speed:** You haven't seen that one obstacle coming and want to stop for a moment to think? No problem! You know that your lemmings are on a safe course to the exit and want to speed things up? No problem either!
+ **Software pattern design:** "Several software pattern designs were used in the implementation in order to have a clear code structure" - I wish i could say that...
Note for future me: **DO NOT** touch singleton pattern if you have any other options.

## Built with
Qt 5.15.

## License
This project is licensed under GPLv3 license.

## Possible development
+ multithreading - unfortunately, it has not yet been implemented which results in limited number of lemmings possible to spawn without introducing noticeable delays.
+ better GUI

Currently I am ocupied with another project that has forced me to learn more about multithreading so I might come back to improve my lemmings in the near future.
